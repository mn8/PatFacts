            While not coming up with facts, he spends his free time playing Rocket League and playing with VR.  A software developer

        <h1>About the site</h1>
        <p>
            PatFacts is a specialized microblogging platform designed to deliver one fact a day to its userbase.  It is developed 
            and designed from the ground up by Patrick Coady and Joe DiFebo, allowing for a maximum level of customization for both Pat
            and its users.  Development on the site is ongoing to constantly push the boundaries of fact-spreading and knowledge-sharing to as
            many people as possible.  The site was established in September 2016.
